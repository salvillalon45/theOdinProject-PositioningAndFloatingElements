## Overall

### What I Learned

-   I really like this project since it help clarify how forms are properly used. I learned about the `legend, fieldset` tags. Also how the nested `input` tags inside label. This allows us to not have to use for on `labels` and id on `inputs`
-   [I had questions on what is inline-block and this guide helped](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-display-inline-vs-inline-block#:~:text=Compared%20to%20display%3A%20inline%2C%20the,%3A%20inline%2Dblock%20they%20are)
-   Also the form tag changes when it is used in React. I noticed that in React we can either use Controlled or Uncontrolled forms. Also I noticed that in React we do not use `action` or `method` as attributes on the form tag. Instead, we handle it in the `onSubmit` function
    -   [More on Controlled and Uncontrolled Components](https://daveceddia.com/react-forms/)
-   [I got curious to see Form Data is send to backend and I came across this guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data). I like how it explains how to use the network tab! I found that really helpful
-   [This was a great explaining for building forms. I like how it showed us all the potential things we can use a in a form](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-forms/)
